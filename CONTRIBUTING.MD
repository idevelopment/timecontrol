# Contributing to Time control.

Looking to contribute something to this repo? **Here is how u can help.**

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Follow these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers
managing and developing this open-source project. In return, they should reciprocate
that respect in addressing your issue or assesing patches and features.

## Using the issue tracker

The issue issue tracker is the preffered channel for bug reports, features requests
and submitting pull requests, but please respect the following restrictions:

- Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests. The gitter channel
is a better place to get help.

- Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions
of others.

- Please make an individual commit for each pull request.

- Keep descriptions short and simple.

## Issues and labels

Our bug tracker utilizes several labels  to help organize and identify issues.
Here's what they represent and how we use them:

- `bug` is used for marking verified bugs.
- `duplicate` is used to marked duplicated issue reports.
- `High Priority` is used to mark things that needs to be done ASAP.
- `In progress` is used for issues where the developers work on.
- `invalid` is used for incorrect reports?
- `question` is used for reports where developers ask things to each other.
- `wontfix` is used for things that doesn't fix at the moment. But later in the dev process.

For a complete look at our labels, see the project labels page

## Bug reports

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Validate and lint your code** - to ensure that the bug is in your own code or not.
2. **Use the github issue search** - check if the issue is already reported.
3. **Check if the issue has been fixed** - try to reproduce it using the lastest `master` or `development` branch in the repo.
4. **isolate the problem** - So the developing doesn't have hard times finding the possible bug.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information.
Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.
What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue?
What browser(s) and OS experience the problem?
Do other browsers show the bug differently?
What would you expect to be the outcome?
All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.


## Pull requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the [coding guidelines](#code-guidelines) used throughout the
project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements
(such as test coverage).

**Do not edit the `.css` files in the public directory or** Those files are automatically generated. You should edit the
source files in `/resources/assets/scss` instead.

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work
included in the project:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd bootstrap
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/user/repo.git
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream master
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description against the `dev` branch.
